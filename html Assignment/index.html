              Hi, I'm Kit. Welcome to my website. I'm a 19 year old student living in London with two older sisters, cockapoo Milou (named after snowy in the French version of tin tin), mum and dad.
              I love computer Science and after University I want to work as a software developer, mainly because I can work from anywhere in the world. As I want to move out of the uk and live in
              different countries would be perfect for me. The countries I want to live in would be either Scandinavian countries, Spanish or New Zealand but I want to visit all of them and decide after.
              The other reason for becoming a software dev is because there are so many jobs going around that pay a lot of money, and getting paid for something you love doing sounds like a dream.
              <br>
              <br>
              Last year I took a year out to work for a software company called Atamate as a junior software dev. They work in the smart building industry, it gave me so much insight with how tech companies run and helped my skills with python improve a lot and really enjoyed it.

            In this picture it shows me on holiday this year. I went to Spain on a beautiful small island called Menorca. Me and three of my friends rented a car and drove all around the island.
            It was the first time going abroad without my family and I enjoyed it so much. Even though we went for only three days we did everything you can do on that island.

          <p>
            I created a time table for each day of the week which includes what module I should aim to revise in my free time. This shows my study skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my group project in my Software Engineering module I volunteered to ask write up and questions to the client, this is an example of my confident Communication skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my computer science class and outside of that I have made very trusting relationships, also with students who are in the year above also doing computer science and they
            have answered my questions about what challenges to expect this first year, this shows my healthy relationship development.
